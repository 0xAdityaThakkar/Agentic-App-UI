# Agentic-App-UI

Minimal UI scaffold for building and testing agentic applications locally.

## Quick start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

	```bash
	python -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```

2. Install dependencies (use your preferred tool):

	- With Poetry: `poetry install`
	- With pip (if you have a requirements file or an installable package): `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -e .`

3. Run the app:

	```bash
	python main.py
	```

## Files

- `main.py` — app entry point
- `pyproject.toml` — project metadata / dependencies

## Notes

- This README is intentionally short. Add usage examples, dependency instructions, or a license file as the project grows.
- License: check `LICENSE` in the repo (none included by default).
